# Current rules/greeting:
Welcome to the L4E YouTube and podcast community! Be excellent to each other. Offtopic chat is encouraged, but no politics & no piracy. Also, this is not a tech support group.

# Expanded rules and explanations

1) In a nutshell, be excellent to one another.
	* We're all here to learn and grow
2) Remember the human.
	* We live in a world that pits ideas and ideologies against each other for domination and control. Remember that the person espousing an idea you hotly disagree with is a **person**, and not a placeholder for the idea. Please treat them as such.
3) Treat one another as friends, not verbal combatants or sparring partners.
4) The offering of opinions is optional.
	* If you disagree with someone, think carefully whether offering a contrary opinion will benefit the community, or merely embroil it in a tit-for-tat of clashing egos
5) Welcome home
	* The Linux4Everyone community is just that -- *for* everyone. Please keep that in mind in your conversations and your approach to communicating with others in the community
	* Here, you have nothing to prove, and nothing to earn.
6) Offtopic chat is encouraged
	* We don't take ourselves too seriously. Feel free to discuss topics tangential to Linux and computing.
7) Banned topics
	* In general, keep things light, don't make it weird.
	* No politics. We know the world is not in a great place right now. That's part of why this community exists â€” not necessarily to face heavy issues head-on, but to provide a positive and uplifting space to share nerdy ideas
	* No piracy. The dark web is that-a-way
8) Not a support forum
	* We do occasionally *discuss* technical challenges we are facing, but without the expectation that someone else will have a quick answer to our problem, or one at all. It's ok to ask for help, but come expecting a discussion, not a solution.
	* Respect others' time when asking questions. This is more of a pub than a genius bar.
