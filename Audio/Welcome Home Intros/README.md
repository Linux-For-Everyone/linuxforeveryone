The Linux For Everyone podcast has a truly global audience, which is why I always try to highlight that at the beginning of a show. During the opoening theme song, you'll hear something like: 

**"Hi, This is Jason, and I'm listening to Linux For Everyone in Zagreb, Croatia. Welcome Home!"**

Want to hear your voice on the show? Just record an intro like that with any device, in WAV, OGG, MP3 or FLAC format, and upload it here! 

You can also simply email it to linuxforeveryone@pm.me

I've put a few examples into the folder to inspire you...
